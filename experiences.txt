----Dassault Systèmes – AI Software Engineer

- C++/3DEXPERIENCE API & PLM: Designed a native C++ Framework (ENOVIA bypass) for high-performance PLM navigation, opening complex assemblies (20+ features/instances) mainly cars (application on the automobile industry), applying PBR materials, using internal 3DS Apis (Big codebase with multiple thousands of apis)

- Synthetic Data Pipeline: Automated generation of 8 000+ HD multiview renders via openGL frame-buffer orchestration with systematic camera (pose, focal) & lighting metadata export (JSON, masks), bridging between PLM and images for later computervision tasks.

- Designed and implemented a multi-stream attention-based architecture for per-material BRDF prediction, fusing six image-derived modalities (RGB, predicted albedo, normal, depth, shading, residual) across multi-view training with masked pooling, cross-modal attention, and hierarchical feature fusion; achieved improved consistency and reflectance disentanglement through view dropout and re-rendering constraints.

- Procedural & CNN-driven and diffusion Material Matching: Created procedural DSPBR shaders (base color, roughness, metallic); built multi-view CNNs with attention blocks in PyTorch/CUDA (TensorFlow prototypes), achieving >83 % accuracy at different lighting conditions.

- 3D Whiteboard ↔ 3DEXPERIENCE Integration: Developed secure bidirectional pipeline (WebSockets + REST) connecting WebApp stylization (SDXL + ControlNet) to native C++ for automated DSPBR material application, enabling the material application to PLM 3D Models just from an AI generated render with controlnet.

- Documentation & Collaboration: Authored full architecture/API specs and end-user guides; liaised with R&D teams in France and Germany.

- Next-Gen Proof-of-Concept: Explored Rust/WebAssembly for upcoming 3D Whiteboard v2 to enhance browser-based performance and security.
